abstract = {Abstract Spectral embedding is a procedure which can be used to obtain vector representations of the nodes of a graph. This paper proposes a generalisation of the latent position network model known as the random dot product graph, to allow interpretation of those vector representations as latent position estimates. The generalisation is needed to model heterophilic connectivity (e.g. ‘opposites attract’) and to cope with negative eigenvalues more generally. We show that, whether the adjacency or normalised Laplacian matrix is used, spectral embedding produces uniformly consistent latent position estimates with asymptotically Gaussian error (up to identifiability). The standard and mixed membership stochastic block models are special cases in which the latent positions take only K distinct vector values, representing communities, or live in the (K − 1)-simplex with those vertices respectively. Under the stochastic block model, our theory suggests spectral clustering using a Gaussian mixture model (rather than K-means) and, under mixed membership, fitting the minimum volume enclosing simplex, existing recommendations previously only supported under non-negative-definite assumptions. Empirical improvements in link prediction (over the random dot product graph), and the potential to uncover richer latent structure (than posited under the standard or mixed membership stochastic block models) are demonstrated in a cyber-security example.}

abstract = "The community structure that is observed in empirical networks has been of particular interest in the statistics literature, with a strong emphasis on the study of block models. We study an important network feature called node popularity, which is closely associated with community structure. Neither the classical stochastic block model nor its degree-corrected extension can satisfactorily capture the dynamics of node popularity as observed in empirical networks. We propose a popularity-adjusted block model for flexible and realistic modelling of node popularity. We establish consistency of likelihood modularity for community detection as well as estimation of node popularities and model parameters, and demonstrate the advantages of the new modularity over the degree-corrected block model modularity in simulations. By analysing the political blogs network, the British Members of Parliament network and the {\textquoteleft}Digital bibliography and library project{\textquoteright} bibliographical network, we illustrate that improved empirical insights can be gained through this methodology.",

abstract = {The random dot product graph (RDPG) is an independent-edge random graph that is analytically tractable and, simultaneously, either encompasses or can successfully approximate a wide range of random graphs, from relatively simple stochastic block models to complex latent position graphs. In this survey paper, we describe a comprehensive paradigm for statistical inference on random dot product graphs, a paradigm centered on spectral embeddings of adjacency and Laplacian matrices. We examine the graph-inferential analogues of several canonical tenets of classical Euclidean inference. In particular, we summarize a body of existing results on the consistency and asymptotic normality of the adjacency and Laplacian spectral embeddings, and the role these spectral embeddings can play in the construction of single- and multi-sample hypothesis tests for graph data. We investigate several real-world applications, including community detection and classification in large social networks and the determination of functional and biologically relevant network properties from an exploratory data analysis of the Drosophila connectome. We outline requisite background and current open problems in spectral graph inference.},

	abstract = {Given a properly parameterized rational B{\'e}zier curve of irreducible degree, it is well-known that its control polygon is uniquely defined. We prove that this property is peculiar to the B{\'e}zier model. In the rational form associated with any other normalized polynomial basis, Moebius reparameterizations change the control polygon, so the same segment admits different polygons. This feature stems from identifying a remarkable algebraic property of Bernstein polynomials, namely that they provide the only normalized eigenbasis of the linear map, transforming homogeneous control points, that a Moebius reparameterization with fixed endpoints defines. Indeed, preserving the affine control polygon boils down to stretching the homogeneous points, i.e., a map with a diagonal matrix. Our result carries over to the alternative representation of rational curves using trigonometric polynomials so that, once again, the control polygon associated with the corresponding normalized B-basis is the only one enjoying uniqueness.},
